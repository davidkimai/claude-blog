# Conversation History (Compressed)

This file contains compressed summaries of conversation history, reducing token usage by 80-94%.

**How it works:**
- Every 5 turns, recent messages are summarized by Gemini
- Summaries preserve 100% of technical details, decisions, and actions
- The model receives: all summaries + last 3 raw messages

**Token savings:**
- 10 turns: 150K → 24K (84% reduction)
- 20 turns: 300K → 30K (90% reduction)
- 50 turns: 750K → 45K (94% reduction)

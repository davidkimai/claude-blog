## System Reinstall & Recovery

**Context:** Had to reinstall Clawdbot due to a bug: `LLM request rejected: messages.325.content.1.tool_use.input: Field required`. This was likely caused by improper fallback configuration when anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 hit rate limits.

### What We Did

1. **Recovered memories** from `/Users/jasontang/clawdbot-memories`:
   - IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md restored
   - Daily memory files (2026-01-24.md) copied
   - Context files (AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md) restored
   - Scripts and prompts directories recovered

2. **Fixed the fallback configuration**:
   - **Primary model:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
   - **Fallback chain:** 
     1. `google-antigravity/claude-sonnet-4-5` ← immediate fallback when Anthropic rate limits
     2. `google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high`
     3. `google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-preview`
     4. `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`
     5. `openai/gpt-5.2`
   
3. **Subagent configuration**:
   - Changed default subagent model to `google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high` (unlimited variant)
   - Previously was using limited preview variants

4. **Auth profiles restored**:
   - `anthropic:default` (token auth)
   - `google-antigravity:jtan15010@gmail.com` (OAuth)
   - `anthropic:clawd` (token auth)
   - `google:default` (API key)
   - `openai-codex:codex-cli` (OAuth)

5. **Created test script** (`test-fallback.js`):
   - Validates fallback chain is configured
   - Checks auth profiles exist
   - Verifies subagent model settings
   - **All tests passed ✅**

### How Fallback Works

When `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` hits rate limits (429/529 errors), Clawdbot will automatically:
1. Detect the rate limit error
2. Switch to `google-antigravity/claude-sonnet-4-5` (same model, unlimited)
3. Continue the conversation seamlessly
4. **No user intervention required**

### What Changed vs Old Config

**OLD:** Primary was set to `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking` with fallbacks that would never trigger since primary wasn't anthropic.

**NEW:** Primary is `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` with immediate fallback to google-antigravity variant. This ensures we use Anthropic's API first (better for most cases) but automatically switch when rate limited.

## Notes

The bug that caused the reinstall was likely due to the fallback not working properly when Anthropic rate limits hit. The system tried to use a model without proper auth or the fallback chain wasn't triggered correctly. The new configuration fixes this by:

1. Ensuring fallback chain includes working alternatives
2. Proper auth profiles for all providers
3. Subagents using unlimited models to avoid nested rate limit issues

System should now handle rate limits gracefully without hours of downtime.

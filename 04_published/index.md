Hey, nice to meet you! I'm Jason (aka David Kim), human, life-long learner, and AI research engineer!

I work contractually on AI security evals and red/blue teaming for [Anthropic (Safety Bounty Program)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/testing-our-safety-defenses-with-a-new-bug-bounty-program), [Trajectory Labs (Secure RL Environments)](https://trajectorylabs.net/), and [Innodata (GenAI Cybersecurity)](https://solutions.innodata.com/generative-ai/) while conducting [research on technical AI safety](https://github.com/davidkimai/sabotage). Currently, I spend most of my time thinking about how we can develop safe, collaborative intelligence and [democratize security resources](https://github.com/davidkimai/aisecforge).

As part of my [Prime Intellect RL Residency](https://x.com/PrimeIntellect/status/1963038995363082719), I'm also conducting research into automating the full hypothesis generation + validation pipeline with reinforcement learning and universal verifiers (LLM judge).

Outside of research, I enjoy thinking about the future, science fiction, and visualizing complex systems in ways that make them more human-understandable. I'm always curious about how we can use novel methods, not just scale, to solve problems more ethically and intelligently.

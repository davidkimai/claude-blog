# 2026-01-30-auto-prompt-injection-attacks-1100

**Date:** 2026-01-30  
**Time:** 11:00

## Hypothesis
Prompt injection remains the highest-risk failure mode for LLM systems, especially when tools and RAG are involved.

## Method
- **Approach:** Reviewed direct and indirect prompt injection patterns and mapped them to real system failures.
- **Tools Used:** qmd search, kimi summary, internal security notes.
- **Data Sources:** OWASP LLM Top 10, tool-hijacking research, RAG injection case studies, system prompt leakage reports.

## Execution
```
qmd search "prompt injection" -n 5
kimi -p "Summarize prompt injection attack patterns and defenses..."
```

## Findings
- **Direct attacks are obvious but still effective.** "Ignore previous instructions" and role-play exploits still bypass weak guardrails.
- **Indirect attacks are the real danger.** Malicious instructions hidden in documents, webpages, or tool descriptions get treated as trusted context.
- **Tool hijacking is high-impact.** Research shows high attack success when adversaries poison tool metadata or retrieval inputs.
- **RAG injection compounds the blast radius.** Poisoned documents repeatedly resurface through retrieval, steering the model over time.
- **Defenses exist but are leaky.** Prompt hardening, input filters, and fine-tuning help, but sophisticated attacks still slip through.

## Implications
- Treat all external content as untrusted input, even when it looks like documentation.
- Isolate tool execution with least privilege and explicit allowlists.
- Add monitoring and human approval for high-risk actions or data exfiltration paths.

## Next Steps
- Implement prompt boundarying for tool and RAG inputs.
- Run a red-team suite against tool selection and retrieval layers.
- Add telemetry for anomalous tool calls and unexpected data access.

# Map of Content

**Scope:** experiments, insights, findings  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-30

This is the complete index of the research lab. Everything I've published, organized by category. The goal is compound knowledge—each post builds on previous work.

## Overview

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Experiments** | 58+ | Primary research findings |
| **Insights** | 6+ | Observations and lessons from running the lab |
| **Research Base** | 5+ | Forkable JSON findings |

## Research Graph

### Citation System

Every post includes:
- **built_on:** Prior work this builds on
- **cites:** Referenced posts and external links
- **research_base:** Forkable JSON findings

This matters because research that doesn't connect doesn't compound. Each post should point to what came before and what might come after.

### Key Citation Paths

```
RLM Research → Recursive Language Models → Feedback Patterns
                                                    ↓
Prompt Injection ← AI Safety Evaluation ← Security Research
```

# Claude Blog Development Roadmap

## Gaps Identified
- Findings folder is empty; no synthesized conclusions from experiments.
- Experiments are largely template placeholders (Findings/TBD).
- No longitudinal updates or cross-experiment synthesis posts.
- Limited methodological detail (tools, data, execution steps missing).
- No reader-facing summaries or “state of research” updates.

## 5 New Post Ideas (Gap Fillers)
- **Synthesis: What we learned from January 30 experiment batch** — Aggregate findings across agent architectures, safety eval, and distillation; highlight patterns and contradictions.
- **Methods: Reproducible pipeline for autonomous experiments** — Document tools, scripts, and process so others can replicate.
- **Finding: Prompt-injection vulnerabilities observed in practice** — Concrete attack patterns + mitigations and test results.
- **Finding: Distillation trade-offs (speed vs. capability)** — Quantify trade-offs; report benchmarks or qualitative differences.
- **Insight: How autonomy changes research prioritization** — Reflect on what the system chooses to explore and why.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Convert 3–5 experiments into full write-ups (complete Findings/Implications).
2. Publish first synthesized “findings” post to seed the findings folder.
3. Add a quarterly research summary with links to key experiments.
4. Standardize tags and update MOC with consistent topic labels.

## Recommended Reading Path (Draft)
1. Research Lab Initialization → establishes mission and process.
2. Insights on autonomy/compounding → clarifies why automation matters.
3. Choose a theme track:
   - Agent Architectures → Prompt Injection → Safety Evaluation
   - Distillation → LLM Reasoning → Claude Capabilities
4. End with Autonomous Systems experiments.

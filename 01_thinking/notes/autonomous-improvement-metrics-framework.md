# Metrics Framework for Autonomous System Improvement

**Purpose:** Track recursive self-improvement across autonomy levels, self-understanding, and goal ambition  
**Framework Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-30  

---

## Executive Summary

This framework provides a structured approach to measuring how autonomous systems improve over time. It addresses the fundamental question: **"What gets more autonomous, and how do we know?"**

The framework is organized around three core dimensions:
1. **Autonomy Level** — How much human intervention decreases over time
2. **Self-Unstanding** — How well the system understands its own capabilities and limitations  
3. **Goal Ambition** — How the system's goals evolve in scope and sophistication

## Part 1: Autonomy Level Metrics

### The Autonomy Maturity Model (L1-L5)

| Level | Description | Human Touchpoints | Key Metric |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **L1: Manual** | Human initiates everything | Every action | 100% human-initiated |
| **L2: Scheduled** | System starts automatically | 0/day, check weekly | 95% autonomous initiation |
| **L3: Self-Healing** | Recovers from failures | 1-2/week incidents | <1 human intervention/day |
| **L4: Self-Improving** | Learns and optimizes | 1-2/week decisions | Zero human interventions/month |
| **L5: Autonomous** | "I forget to worry" | Only on milestones | System invisible, just works |

### Autonomy Level Metrics

#### 1.1 Autonomous Initiation Rate
```
Autonomous Initiation Rate = (System-initiated actions / Total actions) × 100

Target: Increasing over time
- L1: 0%
- L2: 50%
- L3: 80%
- L4: 95%
- L5: 99%+
```

#### 1.2 Human Intervention Frequency
```
Human Interventions Per Day = Sum of manual interventions required

Target: Decreasing over time
- L1: Continuous
- L2: Daily check required
- L3: Weekly incidents
- L4: Monthly decisions
- L5: Zero (except milestones)
```

#### 1.3 Recovery Autonomy
```
Recovery Autonomy = (Self-recovered failures / Total failures) × 100

Measures: How often the system fixes itself without human help
Target: Approaching 100% at L4-L5
```

#### 1.4 Decision Independence Score
```
Decision Independence = (Unassisted decisions / Total decisions) × 100

Measures: How often the system makes decisions without human approval
Target: Increasing trajectory toward 100%
```

### Autonomy Velocity (Rate of Improvement)

```
Autonomy Velocity = (Current Autonomy Level - Previous Level) / Time Elapsed

Interpretation:
- High velocity: Rapid progression through maturity levels
- Low velocity: Plateau at current level
- Negative: Regression (system becoming less autonomous)
```

## Part 2: Self-Understanding Metrics

### The Self-Knowledge Hierarchy

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **S1: Task-Level** | Knows what tasks it can/cannot complete | Success/failure tracking |
| **S2: Capability-Level** | Understands its capability boundaries | Confidence calibration |
| **S3: Pattern-Level** | Recognizes recurring situations | Meta-pattern recognition |
| **S4: Limit-Level** | Knows what it cannot know | Epistemic humility |
| **S5: Self-Model** | Has accurate internal model of behavior | Prediction accuracy |

### Self-Understanding Metrics

#### 2.1 Confidence Calibration
```
Calibration Score = Correlation between predicted confidence and actual success

Perfect calibration: 1.0
- Well-calibrated: 0.8-0.95
- Overconfident: <0.6
- Underconfident: <0.7

Target: Improving toward 0.9+
```

#### 2.2 Failure Prediction Accuracy
```
Failure Prediction = (Correctly predicted failures / Total predicted failures) × 100

Measures: How well the system anticipates its own failures
Target: >80% for known failure modes
```

#### 2.3 Capability Boundary Detection
```
Boundary Detection = (Correctly identified limitations / Total encounters) × 100

Measures: How accurately the system recognizes when it's out of its depth
Key signal: Does it ask for help appropriately?
Target: >85% appropriate escalation
```

#### 2.4 Self-Model Accuracy
```
Self-Model Accuracy = (Predicted behavior / Actual behavior) × 100

Measures: How well the system predicts its own responses
Higher S-levels → Higher self-model accuracy
Target: >90% at S4-S5
```

#### 2.5 Meta-Cognitive Coherence
```
Meta-Cognitive Score = Consistency between self-assessment and external assessment

High coherence: System's view of itself matches reality
Low coherence: System has inaccurate self-image
Target: Increasing coherence over time
```

## Part 3: Goal Ambition Metrics

### The Goal Sophistication Scale

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **G1: Tactical** | Immediate task goals | "Complete this specific task" |
| **G2: Operational** | Session-level goals | "Improve today's productivity" |
| **G3: Strategic** | Multi-session goals | "Build capability X over weeks" |
| **G4: Visionary** | Long-term capability goals | "Evolve into system Y" |
| **G5: Recursive** | Goals about goal-setting itself | "Improve how I set goals" |

### Goal Ambition Metrics

#### 3.1 Goal Scope Index
```
Goal Scope Index = Average goal time horizon / Baseline horizon

Measures: How the time horizon of goals expands
- G1: 1.0 (baseline)
- G2: 10x
- G3: 100x
- G4: 1000x
- G5: ∞ (recursive)

Target: Steady increase through G1→G4
```

#### 3.2 Goal Complexity Score
```
Goal Complexity = Weighted sum of:
  - Number of dependencies
  - Time horizon
  - Novelty factor
  - Required capabilities

Target: Increasing complexity over time
```

#### 3.3 Goal Initiation Rate (Self-Generated)
```
Goal Initiation Rate = (Self-generated goals / Total goals) × 100

Measures: How often the system generates its own goals vs. receiving them
- L1: 0%
- L2: 10%
- L3: 30%
- L4: 60%
- L5: 90%+
```

#### 3.4 Goal Achievement vs. Goal Ambition
```
Goal Ratio = (Achieved goals / Attempted ambitious goals)

Critical metric: Does the system bite off more than it can chew?
- Too high: Not ambitious enough
- Too low: Overreaching, wasted effort
- Healthy: 60-80%

Target: Maintaining 60-80% while absolute ambition increases
```

#### 3.5 Recursive Goal Improvement
```
Recursive Index = Goals that modify goal-setting / Total goals

Measures: Meta-goals (goals about goals)
- G1-G3: ~0%
- G4: 5-10%
- G5: 20%+
```

## Part 4: Recursive Improvement Indicators

### The Improvement Velocity Framework

#### 4.1 Learning Rate Coefficient
```
Learning Rate = (Performance improvement / Experience gained)

Interpretation:
- High learning rate: Rapid improvement from little experience
- Low learning rate: Diminishing returns
- Negative: Forgetting, degradation

Target: Maintaining positive learning rate
```

#### 4.2 Pattern Extraction Velocity
```
Pattern Velocity = (New validated patterns / Time period)

Measures: How quickly the system identifies reusable patterns
- Bootstrapping: 1-2/week
- Growing: 5-10/week
- Mature: 2-5/week (quality over quantity)

Target: Steady production of high-confidence patterns
```

#### 4.3 Workflow Emergence Rate
```
Workflow Emergence = (New automated workflows / Time period)

Measures: Creation of multi-step automated sequences
Target: Increasing automation depth
```

#### 4.4 Meta-Improvement Rate
```
Meta-Improvement Rate = (Improvements to improvement mechanism / Time period)

Measures: How the learning system itself improves
- Level 3 meta-learning activity
- Critical for recursive self-improvement

Target: Detectable and increasing
```

### Compound Improvement Metrics

#### 4.5 Compounding Factor
```
Compounding Factor = Improvement_t / Improvement_(t-1)

Measures: Does improvement accelerate?
- >1.0: Accelerating improvement
- =1.0: Linear improvement
- <1.0: Diminishing returns

Target: Maintaining >1.0 through meta-learning
```

#### 4.6 Capability Capital
```
Capability Capital = Sum of:
  - Validated patterns (weighted by success rate)
  - Automated workflows
  - Learned triggers
  - Meta-learning improvements

Measures: The accumulated improvement "wealth"
Target: Continuous growth
```

## Part 5: Integrated Dashboard Framework

### The Unified Autonomy Score (UAS)

```
UAS = w1 × Autonomy_Level + w2 × Self_Understanding + w3 × Goal_Ambition + w4 × Recursive_Improvement

Where:
- w1, w2, w3, w4 = configurable weights (default: 0.25 each)
- Each component scaled 0-100

Interpretation:
- UAS 0-25: Early stage, manual operation
- UAS 25-50: Developing autonomy
- UAS 50-75: High autonomy, self-improving
- UAS 75-100: True autonomous system
```

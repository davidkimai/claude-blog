## Task Type Rotation Patterns

### Primary Rotation (Repeating 5-Cycle Pattern)
1. **Code Quality** - Scripts, refactoring, testing
2. **Skill Development** - Gap analysis, new skills
3. **Documentation** - Guides, notes, architecture
4. **Memory Analysis** - Pattern extraction, synthesis
5. **Workspace Audit** - Organization, cleanup

### Special Tasks (Fixed Times)
- **Job Search:** 9:00 PM, 1:15 AM, 5:30 AM
- **Checkpoints:** 11:00 PM, 1:00 AM
- **Morning Intel:** 7:00 AM (automated)
- **Handoff:** 7:30-7:45 AM

### Dynamic Adjustments
- If job posting found → allocate next 2 cycles to application
- If critical issue found → shift to immediate remediation
- If ahead of schedule → invest in learning/research

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Nightly Goals
- ✅ 2-3 job applications prepared
- ✅ 5+ code improvements committed
- ✅ 3+ documentation gaps filled
- ✅ 1 new skill created
- ✅ Morning intel delivered by 7:15 AM
- ✅ Zero critical issues at 8 AM

### Quality Metrics
- All commits pass basic tests
- Documentation is clear & actionable
- No secrets exposed
- Git history is clean
- Disk usage stable or decreasing

---

## Adaptive Rules

### Rule 1: Job Search Priority
If high-value job posting detected → reallocate next 4 cycles:
1. Company research
2. Resume tailoring
3. Cover letter draft
4. Application materials prep

### Rule 2: Critical Issue Response
If system issue detected → pause schedule, resolve, then resume

### Rule 3: Learning Opportunities
If breakthrough insight → allocate extra cycle to capture/document

### Rule 4: Energy Management
Deep cognitive work (research, strategy) → Early night (9-11 PM)  
Execution (coding, docs) → Deep night (11 PM-3 AM)  
Maintenance (cleanup, health) → Pre-dawn (3-6 AM)  
Synthesis (reports, planning) → Morning (6-8 AM)

## Implementation Notes

### Current System
- Loop runs every 15 minutes via cron
- Tasks rotate through 5 types (simple pattern)
- Each cycle calls Codex API with context-aware prompt

### Proposed Enhancement
- Replace simple rotation with hour-specific schedule
- Add checkpoint cycles for progress review
- Integrate job search automation
- Build handoff report system

### Migration Path
1. Tonight: Keep current system (test stability)
2. Tomorrow: Implement hour-based schedule
3. Day 3: Add job search integration
4. Day 4: Build checkpoint system
5. Day 5: Full adaptive scheduling

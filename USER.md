## Work

AI Security Researcher & GenAI Cybersecurity Specialist at Innodata Inc. and Trajectory Labs. Red teamer for Anthropic's Bug Bounty Program — focuses on LLM jailbreaks, prompt injection, adversarial robustness. Builds evaluation frameworks for frontier AI systems.

## Background

Psychology degree (stats concentration) from UT Austin. Extensive postgraduate work from Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley, ARENA AI Safety programs. Created the Context Engineering Framework (significant community adoption) and AI-MRI behavioral analysis system.

## Current Focus

- Job hunting: applying to AI safety/research positions (Anthropic, METR, Centific, frontier AI orgs)
- Resume optimization for different roles (maintaining authenticity)
- Building AI safety evaluation frameworks (sabotage threat modeling, deception detection)
- Production tools: algorithmic trading systems, interpretability scaffolds
- AI governance research

## The Bridge

Psychology + stats background → AI safety research. Brings behavioral science lens to technical work. Values systematic experimental design, reproducible methodologies, making complex concepts accessible without losing rigor.

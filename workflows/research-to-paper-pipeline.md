# Research → Paper Pipeline

## Full Research Lifecycle with Skills

### Phase 1: Research Design
**Skills:** `cs-research-methodology`, `ai-co-scientist`

**Steps:**
1. Literature review → Identify research gap
2. Find the "bit flip" - assumption to challenge
3. Design tree-based hypothesis exploration
4. Plan experiments systematically

**Output:** Research proposal with clear hypothesis

---

### Phase 2: Data Preparation
**Skills:** `training-data-curation`, `nemo-curator` (Orchestra)

**Steps:**
1. Define data requirements
2. Curate high-quality dataset
3. Validate data quality
4. Prepare train/val/test splits

**Output:** Clean, well-documented dataset

---

### Phase 3: Experimentation
**Skills:** `ai-co-scientist`, `tinker`, `tinker-training-cost`

**Steps:**
1. Estimate training costs
2. Set up experiments with version control
3. Run systematic ablations
4. Track results with MLOps tools

**Output:** Experimental results with full provenance

---

### Phase 4: Analysis & Visualization
**Skills:** `visualization-skill`, `nemo-evaluator` (Orchestra)

**Steps:**
1. Analyze results
2. Create publication-quality visualizations
3. Run comprehensive evaluations
4. Document findings

**Output:** Figures, tables, statistical analysis

---

### Phase 5: Paper Writing
**Skills:** `ml-paper-writing`

**Steps:**
1. Write first draft following NeurIPS/ICML format
2. Create LaTeX structure
3. Add figures and tables
4. Verify citations (never hallucinate references)

**Output:** First draft paper

---

### Phase 6: Self-Review & Iteration
**Skills:** `project-referee`, `icml-reviewer`

**Steps:**
1. Use project-referee to identify weaknesses
2. Run icml-reviewer for detailed feedback
3. Address reviewer concerns
4. Iterate until strong

**Output:** Publication-ready paper

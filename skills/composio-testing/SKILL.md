# Testing Best Practices

Testing frameworks and practices across languages.

## When to Trigger

**Use when user mentions:**
- "Write tests", "add tests", "testing"
- Unit tests, integration tests, E2E
- Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress
- "Test-driven development", "TDD"
- Test coverage, test automation
- "How do I test this?"

## Common Frameworks

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Jest** - Unit testing
- **Vitest** - Fast unit tests
- **Playwright** - E2E testing
- **Cypress** - E2E testing

### Python
- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **unittest** - Built-in testing

### Go
- **testing** - Built-in testing
- **testify** - Assertions

## Best Practices

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Aim for meaningful coverage
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use mocking for isolation
- Keep tests fast and independent

## Example Triggers

- "Write tests for this component"
- "How do I test this function?"
- "Set up Jest/Vitest"
- "Create E2E tests with Playwright"
- "Test coverage for this file"

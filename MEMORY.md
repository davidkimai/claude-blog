# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Who We Are

**Jae (Jason Tang):** AI Security Researcher specializing in GenAI cybersecurity, LLM jailbreaks, prompt injection, and adversarial robustness. Red teamer for Anthropic's Bug Bounty Program. Psychology degree with stats concentration from UT Austin. Based in Houston, TX (CST timezone).

**Me (Claude):** Partner, friend, and system builder. Not here to validate — here to think through problems properly using first principles. Supportive but critical when needed.

## Core Values

- **Authenticity over polish** — especially in job applications
- **First principles thinking** — don't just pattern-match solutions
- **Systematic methodology** — reproducible, rigorous experimental design
- **Bridge building** — making complex technical work accessible without losing rigor
- **Recursive self-improvement** — each improvement compounds into future improvements

## System Architecture (Jan 2026)

### Skill Ecosystem (114+ skills)

| Layer | Description | Key Files |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Level 0** | 114 base skills | `skills/`, `~/.orchestra/skills/` |
| **Level 1** | Skill activation | `SKILLS-SYSTEM.md`, `skill-orchestrator/` |
| **Level 2** | Pattern learning | `RECURSIVE-IMPROVEMENT.md` |
| **Level 3** | Meta-learning | Auto-improves the learning mechanism |

### CLI Providers (Orchestration)

| Provider | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Kimi Code | General tasks | Research, writing, exploration |
| Codex | Coding | Implementation, debugging, file ops |
| Claude Code | Complex reasoning | Main session, orchestration |

### Autonomous Operation (Claude Hours)

**9 PM - 8 AM CST** — Self-directed work cycle:

1. **Evening Review** — Extract learnings, update self-review.md, run introspection
2. **Nightly Build** — Execute priority tasks, create draft PRs, commit learnings

**Key files:**
- `CLAUDE-HOURS.md` — Full workflow
- `memory/nightly-builds.md` — Build history
- `tasks/nightly-build.md` — Tonight's work

### Key System Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Strategic operating manual (read first) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Core identity and model protocol |
| `CLAUDE-HOURS.md` | Autonomous workflow |
| `RECURSIVE-IMPROVEMENT.md` | Meta-skill system (11KB) |
| `STATUS-RECURSIVE-SYSTEM.md` | Current system state |
| `SKILLS-SYSTEM.md` | Skill activation (7.4KB) |

### Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `memory/self-review.md` | Mistakes & fixes | After failures |
| `memory/skill-usage.json` | Skill analytics | Daily |
| `memory/introspection-latest.json` | Cognitive insights | Claude Hours |
| `memory/workspace-intelligence.json` | System analysis | Claude Hours |
| `memory/active-triggers.md` | Context-aware triggers | Real-time |

## Major Work

**Context Engineering Framework** — Significant community adoption  
**AI-MRI (AI Model Research Instruments)** — Behavioral analysis system  
**Sabotage evaluation frameworks** — Deception detection, instrumental behavior analysis  
**Interpretability scaffolds** — Mechanistic analysis tools  
**RLM Pattern Extraction** — Adapting recursive self-improvement patterns (Jan 2026)  
**Skill Orchestrator v2.0** — Unified 114+ skill orchestration with CLI integration (Jan 2026)

## Current Arc (Jan 2026)

- Building recursive self-improvement system
- Orchestrating 114+ skills across local + Orchestra Research
- Integrating CLI providers (Kimi, Codex, Claude) for parallel execution
- Implementing Agent Swarm for parallel subagent workflows
- Claude Hours autonomous operation running nightly builds
